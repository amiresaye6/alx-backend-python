# Unit and Integration Tests

Unit tests and integration tests are two different types of tests commonly used in software development to ensure the quality and correctness of code. Understanding the difference between these two types of tests is crucial for writing effective test cases.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual units or components of code in isolation. These units can be functions, methods, or classes. The purpose of unit tests is to verify that each unit of code behaves as expected and produces the correct output for a given input.

Common testing patterns used in unit tests include:

- **Mocking**: Mocking is the process of creating fake objects or dependencies to simulate certain behaviors or responses. This allows for isolated testing of a specific unit without relying on external dependencies.

- **Parametrizations**: Parametrizations involve running the same test with different input values. This helps ensure that the unit handles various scenarios correctly.

- **Fixtures**: Fixtures are reusable objects or data that are set up before running tests and cleaned up afterward. They provide a consistent environment for testing and help reduce code duplication.

## Integration Tests

Integration tests, on the other hand, focus on testing the interaction between different components or modules of an application. These tests ensure that the integrated system functions correctly as a whole and that the components work together seamlessly.

While unit tests isolate individual units, integration tests involve testing the integration points and interactions between these units. This includes testing APIs, databases, external services, and other dependencies.

In addition to the common testing patterns mentioned above, integration tests may also involve:

- **End-to-end testing**: End-to-end testing involves testing the entire application flow, from the user interface to the backend systems. It ensures that all components work together as expected and that the application meets the desired requirements.

- **Data setup and teardown**: Integration tests often require setting up test data in databases or other external systems before running the tests. This ensures that the tests are executed in a controlled environment and that the data is cleaned up afterward.
