## Async and Await Syntax

Python introduced native support for asynchronous programming with the `async` and `await` keywords. These keywords allow you to write asynchronous code that is more readable and maintainable.

```python
async def async_function():
    # asynchronous code here
    pass

async def main():
    await async_function()
```

## Executing an Async Program with asyncio

To execute an asynchronous program, you can use the `asyncio` library, which provides a foundation for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines.

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Your asynchronous code here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Running Concurrent Coroutines

`asyncio` enables you to run multiple coroutines concurrently using `gather()` or `wait()` functions.

```python
async def coroutine1():
    # coroutine1 code

async def coroutine2():
    # coroutine2 code

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(coroutine1(), coroutine2())
```

## Creating asyncio Tasks

You can create and manage tasks in asyncio using the `create_task()` method.

```python
async def task_function():
    # Task code here

async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(task_function())
    await task
```

## Using the Random Module

Python's `random` module provides functions to generate random numbers, which can be useful in various scenarios.

```python
import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
print(random_number)
```
